# Trilinos

The Trilinos Project is a community of developers, users and
user-developers focused on collaborative creation of algorithms and
enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework
for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering
and scientific problems on new and emerging high-performance computing
(HPC) architectures.  Trilinos is composed of packages addressing
various computational needs of engineering and scientific simulations.

The Trilinos Project is part of the nonprofit [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org).

## Trilinos Philosophy

"The Trilinos project was established to address two important
needs: (1) bringing teams of library developers together in order
to leverage commonalities and produce compatible software components,
formally called packages and (2) to amortize the cost and efforts
associated with more formal software engineering requirements. With
a modest level of coordination and without unduly compromising
package team autonomy, Trilinos project members could leverage each
other’s efforts, consolidate commonly needed tools, make packages
compatible, and define a common set of software engineering tools
and processes."  -- Heroux and Willenbring, "A new overview of the
Trilinos project", Scientific Programming 20 (2012) 83–88
